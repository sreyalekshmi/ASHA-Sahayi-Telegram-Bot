# Ethical AI Statement – ASHA Sahayi

ASHA Sahayi is designed to support ASHA workers, not to replace medical professionals or human judgment.

The bot provides **informational health guidance only** and does not diagnose illnesses or prescribe medication. All responses encourage consulting a doctor or health center when symptoms persist or worsen.

A **human-in-the-loop** approach is maintained: ASHA workers explicitly decide follow-up requirements, ensuring that medical decisions remain human-led.

Patient data is stored **locally using SQLite**, and no personal health information is shared externally. API keys and sensitive credentials are protected using environment variables and excluded from version control.

Overall, ASHA Sahayi demonstrates a **responsible and community-centered use of Generative AI**, prioritizing medical safety, data privacy, and trust in frontline healthcare settings.
